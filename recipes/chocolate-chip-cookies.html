        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>What would be of the world without chocolate chip cookies? I can tell you something, it wouldn't be a happy one. 
            Here's the catch though, everybody has a different ideal for the perfect chocolate chip coookies.
            Some people like them hard enough that it can break a teeth, other people people like it almost raw; but I 
            prefer to think that most civilized people like the type that you can chew like a cow and feel fine about life.</p>

        <p>The point I actually want to make clear here is, this is one of the many perfectly delicious chocolate chip cookies recipes. 
            I don't guarantee you will like it, but you have to try it. I think this is part of the way for mutual understanding, you see. 
            Important detail, an oven is a must. If you have one, great! You're minutes away from being able to brag about the best thing you 
            have ever made. Yes, a cookie.</p>
